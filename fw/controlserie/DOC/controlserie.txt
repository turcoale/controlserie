Module "TIMER"     (bean FreeCntr)
   - TIMER_Reset -This method resets the timer-counter (sets to zero for up-counting HW or to appropriate value for 
                down-counting HW). The method is available only if the counter register can be set by software and the counter 
                is not shared.
   - TIMER_GetCounterValue -This method returns a content of the counter.

Module "TM"        (bean Capture)
   - TM_Reset -This method resets the counter register (see implementation note in <General Info>).
   - TM_GetCaptureValue -This method gets the last value captured by enabled timer (see implementation note in <General Info>). 
                The method does not return valid value after initialization or after <Reset> until new capture event (even if 
                the returned Error code is ERR_OK).

Module "PT"        (bean Capture)
   - PT_Reset -This method resets the counter register (see implementation note in <General Info>).
   - PT_GetCaptureValue -This method gets the last value captured by enabled timer (see implementation note in <General Info>). 
                The method does not return valid value after initialization or after <Reset> until new capture event (even if 
                the returned Error code is ERR_OK).

Module "LP"        (bean Capture)
   - LP_Reset -This method resets the counter register (see implementation note in <General Info>).
   - LP_GetCaptureValue -This method gets the last value captured by enabled timer (see implementation note in <General Info>). 
                The method does not return valid value after initialization or after <Reset> until new capture event (even if 
                the returned Error code is ERR_OK).

Module "HP"        (bean Capture)
   - HP_Reset -This method resets the counter register (see implementation note in <General Info>).
   - HP_GetCaptureValue -This method gets the last value captured by enabled timer (see implementation note in <General Info>). 
                The method does not return valid value after initialization or after <Reset> until new capture event (even if 
                the returned Error code is ERR_OK).

Module "Cpu"       (bean MC9S08SH8_20)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
